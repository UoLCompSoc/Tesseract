The King Allmight sent you did he?
We need your help opening a strange door in our world...
It is said that mighty foes in other, connected, worlds must be slain to empty it...
I believe you have THE POWER to change your world.
Why you? Because you're the playable character, that's why!
You may press [ENTER] to choose an adjacent world to our own!
Before you leave, you may wish to train in the slime pen to the south!
If you need healing, I am sure the queen will, urm, see to you...
Once you have slain all 5 all powerful world bosses...
Return to this world and see what lies beyond the door!
